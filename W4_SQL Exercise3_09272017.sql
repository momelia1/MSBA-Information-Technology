Support/Tips:
1. In DimDate table, you can find CalendarYear and CalendarQuarter you may need to use in 'Group By' clause. You also need DateKey to connect the OrderDateKey in FactInternetSales table.
2. 'Where' clause should be always before the 'Group By' clause.
3. All the items in 'Select' clause that are not in any aggregate function should be in 'Group By' clause. */
